# SEPARABILITY-OF-THE-KLEIN-GORDON-EQUATION-ON-THE-KERR-NEWMAN-GEOMETRY-USING-NEWMAN-PENROSE-FORMALISM

The Newman-Penrose formalism is a set of notations collected to treat general relativity in spinor
notation. In this final project, I obtain the radial and angular parts of Teukolsky-like equation
for Kerr-Newman geometry using the Newman-Penrose formalism. The Kerr-Newman metric
describes a very special rotating, charged mass, and solution of the Einstein-Maxwell equations.
In this work, I employ the separation of variables method to show that the Klein-Gordon
equation can be separated in Kerr-Newman geometry by using the Newman-Penrose formalism.
Effort to study the Klein-Gordon equation in accelerating Kerr-Newman geometry by using the
Newman-Penrose formalism is also given.
